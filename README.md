This is an extension for Android Studio I wrote in 2019, for enforcing green coding practices. It implements 12 detection rules and some quick fix thereof, based on an evolving [catalog of android-specific energy code smells](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/).

The successor of this prototype is now [ecoCode Mobile](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode/tree/main/src/android-plugin), based on SonarQube.

# ðŸ’¾ Installation

In 2019 I waded in the undocumented waters of the Android Lint API but since 2021, there exist a documentation: http://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/api-guide.html

For more information about recent changes in Android Lint and how to write custom Lint rules, please see the following links:
