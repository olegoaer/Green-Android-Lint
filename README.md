Here is an extension for Android Studio to help writing greener code. I wrote it in 2019 and now make it publicly available. It implements 12 checks and some quick fix thereof, based on a fast-evolving [catalog of android-specific energy code smells](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/) (expressed in Java but works for Kotlin).

This proof of concept has evolved into [ecoCode Mobile](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode/tree/main/src/android-plugin), based on SonarQube. Feel free to take a look at this new exciting project üî•

# üíæ Installation
* Download [greenchecks.jar](./assets/greenchecks.jar) (tested for Android Lint version 26.3.2)
* Move the file into your `~/.android/lint` directory. Create it if needed
* Restart Android Studio

# üîç Inspections
* Open any Android project
* Select `Analyse>Inspect code` from the top menu
* Select your app Module only
* Focus on the new *Greenness* category reporting

In 2019 I waded in the undocumented waters of the Android Lint API but since 2021, there exist a documentation: http://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/api-guide.html

For more information about recent changes in Android Lint and how to write custom Lint rules, please see the following links:
